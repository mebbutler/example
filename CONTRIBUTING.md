# Contributions and Reproducability

* Please do use this code to check you can get the same results as me using the python code 
* Input dataset provided in repo 
* This is a really specific set of code for studying bacteriocins in my PhD, not expecting any additions to the code or contributions to the functionality 

## Using the code on my own data exports 

* If you are studying bacteriocins, Narwahl should work for your own data exports and generate descriptive figures 
* Will require a curated dataset 
* Get in touch with me if you encounter any bugs 

## What if I find different results?

* Please let me know!
